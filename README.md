# React Native Boilerplate

* Simple example of a React Native app (for IOS only, Android coming soon) with 2 screens only.
* This is an attempt to get you started on your React Native project in which you need routing

## How to use it

### Step 1 - Go through the classic React Native "Getting started"
If you don't have anything installed on your laptop to run React Native apps go through:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html and install everything up to XCode

### Step 2 - Clone the Repo
* Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/latifs/react-native-boilerplate.git`
* run `npm install` to grab the dependencies 
* Make sure to edit the package.json if there is a particular library or version you want to work with
* cd into the folder created
* type `react-native run-ios` (this is for ios only obviously)

### Step 3 - Running the app
* everytime you need to run the app just `react-native run-ios`

### Running tests
